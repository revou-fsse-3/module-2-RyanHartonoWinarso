Hello! My name is Ryan Hartono Winarso

My first project will be about how to create a **game review** website and add my own twist to it with closer relation to the Users, I am planning to add Comment and Scoring system to it.
> Features:
1. Home Page -> Contains recent happenings on the site
2. News Page -> About Website News from the Site Owners/Reviewers
3. Reviews Page -> Basically we add the game into it and then site visitors can add comments to it.
4. About Us Page -> Basic information on the website history

The goal of this project is to make a fast, simple and fun game reviews!
